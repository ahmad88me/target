hasName: "Missing disjointness [1, 2, 3]"
hasCode: "P10"
hasDescription: "The ontology lacks disjoint axioms between classes or between properties that should be defined as disjoint. For example, we can create the classes \"Odd\" and \"Even\" (or the classes \"Prime\" and \"Composite\") without being disjoint; such representation is not correct based on the definition of these types of numbers."

hasName: "Missing inverse relationships"
hasCode: "P13"
hasDescription: "This pitfall appears when a relationship (except for the symmetric ones) has not an inverse relationship defined within the ontology. For example, the case in which the ontology developer omits the inverse definition between the relations \"hasLanguageCode\" and \"isCodeOf\", or between \"hasReferee\" and \"isRefereeOf\"."
